Bootstrap utilizes Sass for a modular and customizable architecture. Import only the components you need, fd
enable global options like gradients and shadows, and write your own CSS with our variables, maps, functions, and mixins. 
Bootstrap 5 is evolving with each release to better utilize CSS variables for global theme styles, individual components, and even utilities. We provide dozens of variables for colors, font styles, and more at a :root level for use anywhere. On components and utilities, CSS variables are scoped to the relevant class and can easily be modified.
